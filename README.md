# Transfer Learning

Data Set used: https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection

## Problem
When using social networks, have you ever encountered a 'fake identity'?
Anyone can create a fake profile image using image editing tools, or even using deep learning based generators.

The images in dataset are composite of different faces, separated by eyes, nose, mouth, or whole face.
Use these expensive images other than images automatically generated by computers to train a classifier for real and fake face images.

## Model
Tranfer learning is used with VGG-16 Network and imagenet weights.
